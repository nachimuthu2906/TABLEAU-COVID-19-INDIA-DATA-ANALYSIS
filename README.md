# COVID-19 India Data Analysis and Visualization in Tableau
## Project Description
 - This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data for India using a CSV dataset. The analysis aims to provide insights into the pandemic's progression and its impact through interactive dashboards created in Tableau. Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed using MS Excel.

#  Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed raw CSV data in MS Excel for accurate analysis.
- State-wise Analysis: Visualized COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities across Indian states.
- Trend Visualization: Showcased daily and cumulative trends over time using Tableau.
- Recovery and Mortality Insights: Highlighted key health metrics such as recovery rates and death ratios.
- Interactive Dashboards: Built user-friendly Tableau dashboards to enable in-depth exploration of the data.

# Tools Used
- Tableau: For creating visualizations and dashboards.
- MS Excel: For data cleaning and preprocessing.

# Visualizations and Insights
- State-wise Case Analysis: Heatmap and bar charts showing case distribution.
- Trend Analysis: Line graphs depicting COVID-19 case trends over time.
- Recovery vs. Fatality Analysis: Visuals illustrating recovery and fatality rates by state.
- Active Case Overview: Map visualizations highlighting regions with high active case counts.

# Key Insights
